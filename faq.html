Two new orders involved on the first or second level of the first cycle of the main table or two orders, involved on any level of the V.I.P. table of orders are considered for all following cycles. Many buyers can meet their obligations by the means of the marketing program, but owner of the order should always be ready to fulfill his order at his own expense..</p></div>

For the Principle seven-celled, VIP and VIP Plus table of orders, the cycle is considered finished, after the order placed on the third level goes to the compensation and the bonus compensation is charged to the Buyer's order on which the gold bars are bought.</p></div>
